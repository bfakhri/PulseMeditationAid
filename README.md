# PulseMeditationAid
Using real-time heart beat tracking and visualization to aid in meditation. 

An arduino UNO tracks a user's pulse in real time using a pulse sensor ([pulsesensor.com](https://pulsesensor.com/). 

The pyton script receives the pulse information and displays it on the screen in order to guide the user's breath in sync with the heart beat.
